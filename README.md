# Battle_Royale_Custom

This is my version of the battle royale from Daniel Buckley. I have changed the game mechanic from instead of being king of the hill style to being more hunters and targets.

Things added/changed in this project:
 - win condition is whoever has the most target kills instead of who survives the longest
 - kills are only added when the player kills their target
 - users now have a target in their HUD to indicate who is their target
 - users will get new targets if their dies

Bugs: The win condition may not correctly display who wins with their kill amount
